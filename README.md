# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.


In this article, I am going to setup a kubernetes cluster on AWS cloud environment up & running with dashboard. I am going to use a tool called KOPS for the cluster setup. 

What is KOPS?
kops is an opinionated provisioning system with 

- Fully automated installation
- Uses DNS to identify clusters
- Self-healing: everything runs in Auto-Scaling Groups
- Limited OS support (Debian preferred, Ubuntu 16.04 supported, early support for CentOS & RHEL)
- High-Availability support
- Can directly provision, or generate terraform manifests

Requirements
An Ubuntu or Debian instance with latest updates, AWS-CLI, S3 bucket, Hosted Zone on Route 53 and domain. I am going to use Ubuntu instance to launch my cluster. 

Installation:
Launch an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance and update to latest packages 
	$sudo apt-get update
	$sudo apt-get -y upgrade

Download the latest version of kops and install it

	$ wget -O kops https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64 
	$ chmod +x kops
	$ sudo mv kops /usr/local/bin/

Download the latest version of the kubectl

	 $ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
	$ chmod +x kubectl
	$ sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Installing AWS Cli to access the AWS from command line. 

  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
  $ pip install --upgrade pip
  $ sudo pip install awscli 
	
On AWS console, create a new IAM user (for example kops) with full access and save the access keys as it would be used to config the AWS Cli. Copy both AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key. 

On EC2 instance, configure the newly created AWS IAM user
	$aws configure 
		AWS Access Key ID [None]: <AWS user access key ID >
		AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <AWS secret access key>
		Default region name [None]:
		Default output format [None]:
	Please enter the AWS access key ID & Secret Access Key for the newly created IAM user. Default region & output format can be left bank.
	
Create a domain for the cluster
kops uses DNS for discovery, inside the cluster and to reach the kubernetes API server from client. Its should be vaild DNS name. You can use subdomain and I recommed to use a subdomain for the cluster configuration. 

You can use an existing domain or register a new domain. In this example, I am going to a domain hosted on dot.tk which is free domain provider. 

Domain registration on dot.tk / freenom.com:
I have registred a new domain on freenom.com with the name k8sclustersetup.tk. 


â€“ S3 bucket
